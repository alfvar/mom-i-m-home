# Mom I'm Home
This is an art project/birthday gift with a ESP8266 light level monitor. I am monitoring the light levels in my apartment and depending on the brightness I will update LED:s on a remote Arduino device, which will be placed in a ceramic model house. This way, the remote model house will light up whenever my lamps are on.
